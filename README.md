## <p align="center">Modern Collection UI Components, Utiities for <img src="https://www.solidjs.com/img/logo/without-wordmark/logo.png" alt="SaftoxUI" width="24" alt="SolidJS" style="vertical-align: top;"> SolidJS</p>

#### Inspired by the popular [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)

While SaftoxUI draws inspiration from these libraries, it introduces many custom solutions and changes, making it unique in its own right. Over time, SaftoxUI may evolve significantly in terms of design, implementation, and features.

> ⚠️ SaftoxUI is in early stage and **not ready** for production ⚠️

## 📦 Features

#### **⚡ SolidJS Integration**

Built specifically for SolidJS, leveraging its reactivity and performance.

#### **🌟 Inspired by NextUI and React Aria**

SaftoxUI takes the best ideas from these libraries and adapts them for SolidJS.

#### **🔧 Custom Solutions**

Expect unique implementations and features that differentiate SaftoxUI from its inspirations.

#### **🎨 Dynamic Styling with Twind**

Unlike NextUI, which generates all styles at build time, SaftoxUI uses [Twind](https://twind.style/) to generate TailwindCSS styles at runtime.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Other features</strong></summary>

#### **🔄 Highly Customizable**

SaftoxUI is designed to be flexible and customizable to fit your project's needs.

#### **🌐 SolidJS Server Components**

All SaftoxUI components are compatible with SolidJS server components, allowing you to import and use them directly in your server-side rendered applications.

#### **♿ Accessible Components**

SaftoxUI components follow the WAI-ARIA guidelines, providing keyboard support and sensible focus management.

#### **🔍 Focus Interactions**

Focus rings will appear only when the user navigates with a keyboard or screen reader.

#### **📦 Modular Packages**

SaftoxUI is divided into multiple packages, so you can install only the components you need.

#### **💻 TypeScript Based**

Build type-safe applications with SaftoxUI's fully-typed API, minimizing the learning curve and helping you build robust applications.

#### **🔄 Polymorphic Components**

A polymorphic `as` prop is included in all SaftoxUI components, allowing you to override component tags.

#### **🎨 Beautifully Designed**

SaftoxUI components are unique and are not tied to any visual trend or design rule, making your projects stand out.

## 🌸 Credits

It would be untrue to suggest that the design here is totally original.
This project is heavily inspired by the following awesome projects.

- [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com/) - The library that makes this all possible.
- [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) - The inspiration behind this project.
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) - For providing foundational accessibility solutions.
- [Solid Aria](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-aria) - The SolidJS implementation of React Aria. The source code primitives was adapted into SaftoxUI codebase as the last update was 2 years ago and the library did not complete the adaptation of primitives. This was done to ensure the completion of all primitives and better maintain the codebase.
- [Twind](https://twind.style) - For runtime TailwindCSS generation. The source code was also integrated into SaftoxUI codebase as the last commit was 2 years ago, and TailwindCSS presets have since changed.
- [Tailwind-Variants](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-variants) - Tailwindcss first-class variant API. The source code was integrated into SaftoxUI codebase as it was not compatible with [Twind](https://twind.style), and require adaptation for use in the project.
- [SolidJS-USE](https://solidjs-use.github.io/solidjs-use) - is a collection of SolidJS utilities inspired completely by [VueUse](https://vueuse.org).
- [Corvu](https://corvu.dev) - Is a collection of open source UI primitives.
